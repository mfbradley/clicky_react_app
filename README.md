#Clicky React Game

Test your memory with this 90's themed **React** game. This project, created using **Create-React-App**, begins by rendering 12 images to the DOM. The object of the game is to click all of the images without clicking on the same image twice. Image **components** listen for **click events** and help to track user score. If an image is clicked more than once it is game over and the game resets, setting to score back to zero and updating the best score when necessary. 

Additional tech used: **ES6**, **JSX**, **Yarn**, and **gh-pages**
